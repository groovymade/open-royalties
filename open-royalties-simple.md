# Royalty Agreement

[ Open Royalties (simple); version 1.0.0 ]

## 1. Purpose

This Agreement sets out the terms under which the **Royalty Rights Holder** purchases a contractual right to receive royalty payments tied exclusively to the **gross revenue of the Project** known as **[Project Name]**, operated by the **Company**.
This Agreement does not grant any rights to the revenue, profits, or assets of the Company as a whole.

## 2. Purchase Price and Reference Calculation

2.1 **Purchase Price**

The Royalty Rights Holder agrees to pay the Company a **Purchase Price** of **[Amount in USD]** in exchange for a limited, contractual right to receive royalty payments as described in this Agreement.
This Purchase Price is paid solely for royalty rights to the **Project** and does not grant any claim or interest in the Company itself.

2.2 **Royalty Pool Reference**

The Royalty Percentage purchased is calculated using the higher of:

- **$5,000,000 USD**, or
- **10×** the Project’s Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) at the time the Purchase Price is received.

This figure shall be referred to as the **Royalty Pool Reference** and is used solely to determine the initial Royalty Percentage.

## 3. Royalty Percentage Formula
```math
\text{Royalty Percentage} = \frac{\text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Royalty Pool Reference}} × 100
```
## 4. Royalty Pool and Adjustments

4.1 **Royalty Pool Cap**

The total royalty obligations under all similar agreements shall never exceed **[X]%** of the Project’s **Gross Revenue**.

4.2 **Proportional Adjustments**

If the Company grants additional royalty rights for the same Project to other parties, all existing Royalty Percentages shall be adjusted proportionally to ensure the total obligations remain within the Royalty Pool Cap. The Royalty Percentage held by the Royalty Rights Holder, after any adjustment, is referred to as the **Adjusted Royalty Percentage**.

## 5. Ongoing Royalty Payments

5.1 **Payment**

The Company shall pay the Royalty Rights Holder’s **Adjusted Royalty Percentage** of the Project’s Net Receipts on a **quarterly basis**, within **[X] days** after the end of each calendar quarter.

5.2 **Definition of Net Receipts**

**Net Receipts** means the total Gross Revenue for the Project in the previous quarter, less:
- Valid refunds and chargebacks,
- Payment processor fees,
- Required sales taxes/VAT.

5.3 **Reporting**

Each quarterly payment shall include a statement showing:
- Total Project Gross Revenue for the prior quarter,
- Total deductions for refunds, chargebacks, processor fees, and taxes,
- Net Receipts for the quarter,
- Total Royalty Pool Percentage,
- Royalty Rights Holder’s Adjusted Royalty Percentage,
- Payment calculation.

## 6. Segregated Revenue Tracking

The Company shall:
- Maintain the Project as a separate profit and loss unit within its accounting software,
- Use a dedicated merchant account or sub-account to receive Project payments wherever practical,
- Keep clear, separate records to track and report Project-specific Gross Revenue.

## 7. Compensation on Sale or Transfer

7.1 **Termination of Royalty Rights**

If the Company sells, transfers, licenses, or otherwise disposes of the Project (in whole or substantial part), the Royalty Rights Holder’s future royalty entitlement shall automatically terminate, and the Royalty Rights Holder shall receive a one-time payment as compensation for the loss of future royalty payments.

7.2 **Amount**

```math
\text{Termination Compensation} = \text{Adjusted Royalty Percentage} × \text{Net Sale Proceeds attributable to the Project}
```

Net Sale Proceeds means the total consideration received for the Project, minus reasonable transaction costs and taxes.

7.3 **Timing**

This compensation shall be paid within **[X] days** of the closing of the transaction.

## 8. Assignment and Non-Equity

The Royalty Rights Holder’s rights under this Agreement:
- Are strictly limited to the Project’s Gross Revenue and any Termination Compensation,
- Do not confer any ownership, equity, profit share, or voting rights in the Company,
- May not be transferred without the Company’s written consent.

## 9. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **[Insert Jurisdiction]**.

## 10. Entire Agreement

This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the Company and the Royalty Rights Holder with respect to the Project. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties.
