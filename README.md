# Open Royalties

**A simple, open framework to share project revenue with early supporters – without the usual strings attached.**

---

## What is Open Royalties?

**Open Royalties** is an easy way for builders to get upfront cash for new projects *without* selling equity or taking on rigid loans.

You raise money from early supporters – they back your idea upfront, and you share a small piece of *project revenue* as you earn.
No big promises. No forced exit. Just clear terms, aligned interests, and real revenue sharing.

## Why this exists

A lot of modern businesses don’t fit old-school funding.

* **Banks:** want collateral and assets.
* **VCs:** want moonshots and unicorns.
* **Revenue lenders:** often have punishing fees or inflexible terms.

**Open Royalties** fills the gap: a simple, flexible way to raise funds for a specific product, feature, or launch – and reward early backers as soon as money comes in.

## What’s included

This repo includes **three ready-to-use templates** for setting up fair, clear royalty deals:

### 📄 `open-royalties-full.md`

* Includes a *steering committee* with a seat for your backers.
* They get a say in the project – not full control – so you keep creative freedom, but they stay in the loop.
* Works well for bigger rounds or a group of backers pooling funds.

### 📄 `open-royalties-simple.md`

* Includes a steering committee - but *no formal seat* for backers.
* You run the project fully yourself while sharing revenue as agreed.
* Great for small, quick deals where you want minimal oversight.

### 📄 `open-royalties-partnerships.md`

* For non-cash deals - partners contribute skills, IP, or work instead of money.
* Clear royalty split based on contribution instead of investment.
* Perfect for collaborations without giving up equity.

All versions are **project-based** – so the rest of your business stays untouched.

## 🔑 How it works

A royalty agreement is just a fair trade:
You get upfront cash to build, launch, or grow – your backers get a slice of the revenue that comes in later.

### ✅ Reference price

The *reference price* is a simple agreed figure for what the project is worth – like a safety net.
If you shut down, sell, or merge the project before everyone’s paid, the reference price makes sure your supporters get a fair payout.

It’s not about “valuation” in the VC sense – just a clear number everyone agrees on, to protect both sides.

### ✅ Revenue share & payback

You decide:

* What % of project revenue gets shared
* For how long
* And what total return your backers receive (for example: you might share 5% of revenue until they’ve received 1.5x what they gave you).

### ✅ Exit plan

If you sell the project before everyone’s paid back:

* You pay out a fair share based on the reference price.
* It keeps things honest and avoids surprises.

## 💡 Why early-stage backers should love it

Backers aren’t stuck waiting years for a big exit – they get returns from day one of real sales.

* **Early upside:** the minute revenue comes in, they share in the success.
* **Aligned goals:** the more the project earns, the better for everyone.
* **Protected:** clear reference price means fair payout if plans change.
